notes:

titles-sorted.txt
	just names of titles
	index position is like the ID

links-simple-sorted.txt
	index position is like the ID (supposed to correspond to titles)

	from 	to (multiple)
	page  : page page page

	so first thing is page, then delimited by : and then 1 or more pages, separated by spaces


HITS:

	so there's two components:

		authority score
		hub score

	authority score is basically, how many pages link TO it

	hub score is basically how many pages its linkes OUT to 

they depend on each other:

	authority: sum of hub scores of pages that link TO it
	hub: sum of authority scores of pages it links OUT to 

calculate scores by SUMMING everything with NORMALIZATION
	normalize by (a^2 + b^2 ...)^(1/2)

	so sum everything, divide by the norm

		WAIT< this is separte step

run algo this way:

	everything initialized with 1
	run Authority Update (SUM ONLY)
	run Hub update (SUM ONLY)
	normalize both 
		hub score: divide each score by: root sum of squares of all hub scores (all!)
		authority score: divide each score by: root sum of squares of all authority scores (all!)


--------

data cleaning: 

	make sure you remove all pages that don't link to it, and that don't link to anything!
